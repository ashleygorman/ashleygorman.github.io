<b>Data on the Brain</b>
<p>In pursuing my degree in data science at Carthage College, I took the following core courses:</p>

<p>CSC 1030 Data Science I;<br>
CSC 1040 Data Science II;<br>
CSC 1810 Principles of Computer Science I;<br>
CSC 2810 Database Design & Management;<br>
BUS 2110 Business Ethics;<br>
MTH 1050 Elementary Statistics;<br>
MTH 1120 Calculus I;<br>
MTH 2040 Linear Algebra;<br>
MTH 3090 Mathematics of Data Science;<br>
MTH 3350 Data Science Portfolio; and<br>
MTH 4350 Data Science Portfolio II.</p>

<p>In addition to the core curriculum, I designed a three-course sequence in neuroinformatics that enabled me to apply my skills to real data. My sequence is as follows:</p>

<p>NEU 2100 Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience;<br>
NEU 2500 Neuroscience Research Methods and Statistical Analysis; and<br>
NEU 4900 Research in Neuroscience.</p>

<p>Taking additional courses in neuroscience—as well as conducting research in the field—has given me hands-on experience and bolstered my analytical proficiency.</p>
