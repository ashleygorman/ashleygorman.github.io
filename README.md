My name is Ashley Gorman. I graduated summa cum laude from Carthage College in May 2022 with a bachelor's degree in data science, minors in computer science and mathematics, and an applied concentration in neuroinformatics. I'm passionate about data analytics and especially working with biological data; I plan to earn my certification in health analytics and work as a healthcare analyst.
