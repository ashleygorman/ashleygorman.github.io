## Hi! I'm Ashley Gorman.

I'm currently studying at Carthage College, where I plan to graduate in May of 2022. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in data science with an applied concentration in neuroinformatics.

Since January of 2021, I've been working on a computational analysis of zebrafish behaviors, particularly their eye movements after an injury to the optic nerve. I'm interested in machine learning and data analysis techniques.
