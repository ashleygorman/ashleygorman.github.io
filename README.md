I'm Ashley Gorman. I'm currently studying at Carthage College, where I plan to graduate in May of 2022. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in data science with an applied concentration in neuroinformatics, as well as minors in computer science and mathematics. I'm passionate about data analytics and especially working with biological data; I plan to earn my certification in health analytics and work as a healthcare analyst.
