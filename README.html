<p>My name is Ashley Gorman. I'm a 2022 data science graduate from Carthage College, and I currently work in data science and engineering as a technology development program associate at Optum. I'm passionate about data analytics—particularly the intersection of data and healthcare—and plan to pursue further studies in health analytics. I'm also interested in deep learning models and their applications in the healthcare industry.</p>
