<b>Computational Analysis of Zebrafish Behavior and the Optokinetic Response</b><br>
<b>Jan. 2021 â€“ present</b>
<p>Zebrafish are able to regenerate their optic nerve after an injury, while humans are not. In order to further understand how this mechanism works, I analyzed zebrafish eye angles using two different programs. I uploaded videos of adult zebrafish to DeepLabCut and labeled individual frames in order to train the neural network to recognize eye movements. I also used Stytra's built-in tracking software to follow eye movements in videos of larval zebrafish. For both adults and larval fish, I generated graphs that show how the eye angles change over time. In working on this project, I've gained experience working with neural networks and furthered my interest in machine learning algorithms. I'm currently working to mathematically analyze the data I've collected and present my conclusions regarding the zebrafish's rate of visual recovery.</p>

<b>Mathematical Analysis of Behavioral Inhibition in SD and WKY Rats</b><br>
<b>Mar. 2022</b>
<p>Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats are said to be behaviorally inhibited, or wary in response to unfamiliar stimuli. In order to test this hypothesis, I worked with a group of neuroscience students to measure the activity of WKY rats over a two-minute interval. We placed the rats in an open-field testing apparatus that is divided into segments, and we measured how long it took each rat to leave the starting segment, how many other segments each rat visited, and how many rearings each rat exhibited. We used Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, a strain that is not behaviorally inhibited, as our control group. I then used SPSS to run a mathematical analysis of the data we collected and used Microsoft Excel to visualize it.</p>

<b>Using K-Means and K-Means++ to Sort Similar Animals</b><br>
<b>Apr. 2021</b>
<p>I worked with a datset of animals that each had a number of features, such as each animal's number of legs or whether or not it had a tail. I used these features with sklearn's k-means algorithm in order to create clusters and assign similar animals to each of them. I then implemented my own k-means++ algorithm and sorted the same data again.</p>
