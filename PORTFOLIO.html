<b>Computational Analysis of Zebrafish Behavior and the Optokinetic Response</b><br>
<b>Jan. 2021 â€“ present</b>
<p>Zebrafish are able to regenerate their optic nerve after an injury, while humans are not. In order to further understand how this mechanism works, I analyzed zebrafish eye angles using two different programs. I uploaded videos of adult zebrafish to DeepLabCut and labeled individual frames in order to train the neural network to recognize eye movements. I also used Stytra's built-in tracking software to follow eye movements in videos of larval zebrafish. For both adults and larval fish, I generated graphs that show how the eye angles change over time. In working on this project, I've gained experience working with neural networks and furthered my interest in machine learning algorithms. I'm currently working to mathematically analyze the data I've collected and present my conclusions regarding the zebrafish's rate of visual recovery.</p>
