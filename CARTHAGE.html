<center><p><b>Data on the Brain</b></p></center>
<p>In pursuing my degree in data science at Carthage College, I took the following core courses:</p>

<p>CSC 1030 Data Science I;<br>
CSC 1040 Data Science II;<br>
CSC 1810 Principles of Computer Science I;<br>
CSC 2810 Database Design & Management;<br>
BUS 2110 Business Ethics;<br>
MTH 1050 Elementary Statistics;<br>
MTH 1120 Calculus I;<br>
MTH 2040 Linear Algebra;<br>
MTH 3090 Mathematics of Data Science;<br>
MTH 3350 Data Science Portfolio I; and<br>
MTH 4350 Data Science Portfolio II.</p>

<p>The core classes laid the foundation for my ability to interpret and analyze data. However, in 
order for me to put these skills into practice, it was imperative that the data were placed into context 
through the study of another academic discipline. Pursuing my data science major with a concentration in 
neuroinformatics allowed me to gain a broader understanding of scientific research methods and their 
  practical applications.</p>
  
<p>The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility defines neuroinformatics as "a research field 
devoted to the development of neuroscience data and knowledge bases together with computational 
models and analytical tools for sharing, integration, and analysis of experimental data and advancement of 
  theories about the nervous system function."<sup>1</sup> Neuroinformatics blends the two new, rapidly developing 
fields of neuroscience and data science, introducing methods for processing information and observing 
trends in neuroscientific data. Current research interests in neuroinformatics include developing systems 
for storing large amounts of neuroscientific data and improving our understanding of multisensory 
information processing. This area of study can lead to careers in healthcare and research, and a focus in 
such a wide-ranging field has taught me a variety of skills that prove useful in professional settings.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The following courses, as offered by Carthage College, constitute a strong and well-founded 
  concentration:</p>

<p><b>NEU 2100 Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience:</b> "An introduction to psychological processes as they relate to behavior. Basic neurophysiology 
and sensory processes will be covered along with research relevant to topics or current interest in 
  the field."<sup>3</sup><br>
  • This course is a necessary prerequisite that provided me with a baseline understanding 
of the nervous system, contextualizing the research and analytical methods that I 
used in later courses.<br><br>
  <b>NEU 2500 Neuroscience Research Methods and Statistical Analysis:</b> "This course is an introduction to the methods used in neuroscience research. Students participate 
in experimental design, data collection, statistical analysis and interpretation, and manuscript 
preparation. Students also are exposed to research techniques including surgery, histology, and 
  pharmacological manipulations."<sup>4</sup><br>
  • This course offers an in-depth, hands-on exploration of data collection and analysis, 
which allowed me to apply my knowledge of data science in a laboratory setting.<br><br>
  <b>NEU 4900 Research in Neuroscience: </b>"Students work on an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member."<sup>5</sup><br>
• Completing a research project in neuroscience gave me a unique opportunity to 
perform scientific experiments, collect precise data, apply analytical techniques covered 
in earlier courses, and gain practical experience working in a professional setting.</p>

<p>Studying neuroinformatics has enhanced my abilities to collect and analyze data, think critically about the 
processes used in data science, and work with technology both inside and outside of the laboratory. The 
concentration builds upon the core data science curriculum, enabling me to use my foundational 
knowledge to build a strong portfolio that showcases my applied skills. Moreover, this course sequence 
provides a specific context for such applications in the expansive world of neuroscience. The learning 
opportunities presented in these courses have proven valuable as I utilize my analytical skill set to 
break into a multifaceted, burgeoning field.</p>
